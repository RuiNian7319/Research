# Repository for all my research and results

The folders are split up in the following ways: <br>
1. Results:  All results generated thus far
2. RL_Codes: Codes for reinforcement learning applied to many different examples
3. MPC_Codes: Codes for model predictive control applied to different examples
4. DDPG_Codes:  Codes for all deep deterministic policy gradient applied to different examples
5. PID:  Control problems using PID <br>

Models:  All simulation models I've created.  There are SISO, MISO, SIMO, and MIMO models.  Compatible using scipy or CasaDI <br>
Modules:  All the different modules I've created for reinforcement learning, MPC, and PID.
